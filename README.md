(a)Paintings sorted according to representativity value, from largest to smallest; (b) Famous works from artistâ€™s homepage. Paintings enclosed in a yellow box are famous works reserved for verifying the accuracy of our method; representativity of paintings against the blue background ranges from 0:6 to 1:0, representativity of paintings against the orange background ranges from 0:0 to 0:4. <br>

## Experiment
### Requirements
* python 3.6
* pytorch 1.3.0
 
### Style-Enhanced Art Paintings Representation
#### Training 

The training dataset is collected from [WIKIART](https://www.wikiart.org/)
You can download the pretrained [resnet and vgg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15IIETn17Xgg9TpYacymWPv0NxqEHJMTt/view?usp=sharing)model.
```
python resnet_finetune_unify.py
```
#### Testing 
You can download our pretrained [artist classification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHfg5a_4SHiH6FQAIvH9VXGwJld2HamS/view?usp=sharing) model to obtain image features directly.
```
python feature_generation.py
```
### Graph-Based Representativity Learning
If you just need calculate the representivity, you shoud download [KPL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BSW9W1Qb6MDMiFiHMXevqzBFTNd_bEGB/view?usp=sharing) files.
```
python anchor.py
```
